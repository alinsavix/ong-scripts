# DISCLAIMER: This is some of the worst code I have ever written.
#
# This is a hopefully simple/basic script that watches an OBS instance and
# waits for it to go live, and starts or stops a systemd unit based on that,
# to trigger other things that need to run based on that.
#
# Current idea/design: two different systemd targets, ong-online.target and
# ong-offline.target, which are started based on stream status. The two will
# conflict with each other, so starting one stops the other, and gives us a
# good way to have certain things that only run when the stream is online,
# and some that only run when it isn't.
#
# FIXME: this is probably a great place for some asyncio action, maybe, but
# Alinsa is not smert enough for asyncio yet.
